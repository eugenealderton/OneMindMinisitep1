            <h2>Time Management And It's Benefits</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="content1">
            <p>Undertaking a course at university is a big commitment,
               both in time and energy. Dedication needs to be given towards
               classes, as well as studying the course materials during the
               semester. This affects the amount of time given to personal
               aspects of life such as socializing and hobbies. Learning to
               balance all these factors is an important life skill and to
               aid this is the use of effective time management.
            </p>
            <p>Time is precious, yet the illusion exists that there is not
               enough time available. With effective time management however,
               this illusion disappears and reveals not only the abundant
               amount of time available, but also the extensive list of
               benefits it can achieve.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="content2">
            <h3>The Benefits</h3>
            <p>Here are just some examples of the benefits of effective time management.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><font color="173ab5">Complete Assessments on time – </font>Dealing with assessments
                close to the due date can lead to a loss of focus and
                decrease the quality of work completed. By allocating time
                to the assessment when it is first issued, the task will
                be complete by the due date and most of the time beforehand
                leading to extra time towards personal activities.</li>
              <li><font color="173ab5">Improve Motivation – </font>Keeping a schedule helps the mind and
                body focus. Knowing what task is to be worked on and what
                activities lies ahead cuts out unnecessary time deciding
                on the task to undertake. This means that all tasks related
                to studying can be completed earlier than expected and open
                spare time for personal activities. Handing assessments in
                early is also gives motivation towards completing the next
                assignment and gaining more personal time, instead of
                generating stress about upcoming assessments and the
                illusion of falling behind with workload.</li>
              <li><font color="173ab5">Gradual Grade Improvement – </font>As assessments are being
                undertaken following a schedule, more care and focus is
                given towards them as the stress of the due date is not
                impeding on the mind. This means that the work produced
                will be of a higher quality than when it is completed
                while under stress. It also means there is time to review
                the work completed, remove and small mistakes, or improve
                upon work that is decided as unsatisfactory. The quality of
                the work and effort put in will reflect on the grades
                received as they increase, which will give motivation
                towards excelling in the next assessment, and the
                course overall.</li>
              <li><font color="173ab5">Improve Reliability – </font>Benefits of effective time management
                not only impact studying, but also personal image as well.
                Meeting deadlines, arriving to appointments on time, and being
                punctual are just some of these benefits. This will also be
                noticed by colleagues, family and peers as time passes,
                improving image and reliability shown towards others.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="content3">
            <p>By keeping a managed schedule of all activities and allocating
              time towards each effectively, it can lead help balance life
              activities while also achieving desired goals. By learning how
              to break down time effectively as shown in the next page,
              it will help achieve the many benefits of effective
              time management.
