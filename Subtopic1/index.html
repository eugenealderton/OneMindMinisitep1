            <h2>Time Breakdown</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="content1">
            <p>Time management is an integral part of any major task,
              including university studies. Balancing between studies,
              work, social and life commitments can appear challenging,
              but with effective time management this balance can be achieved.
            </p>
            <p>Breaking down the time spent on activities can go a long way.
              It allows measurement for how much time is being allocated to
              a task, and if that time amount needs to be adjusted. From
              there a daily, weekly, and even semester long schedule can
              be produced to assist in handling assessments, but also
              visualize how much time there is available for both studies
              and personal time.
            </p>
            <p>Each of the following sections should be used in conjunction
              with one another to achieve an effective time planner for an
              entire semester of studies.
            </p>

            <h3>Time Inventory</h3>
            <div class="imageinsert">
              <img class="logo" src="timeinventory.png" alt="inventoryimage" float="left">
            </div>
            <p>Breaking down the time required for each daily activity in
              life can help effectively visualize how much time is spent
              on an activity, and how much actual time there is available
              for personal activities and studying. This helps analyse
              just how much time is available but it can also be adjusted to
              include unscheduled events.
            </p>

            <p>A detailed breakdown of the time inventory. It shows the amount
              of time allocated towards each activity and reveals if too much
              time is being spent on certain activities such as leisure.
              University studies require dedication and an appropriate amount
              of time should be allocated towards achieving results.

            </div>
            <p>A weekly breakdown helps keep track of time available for
              studies and personal activities. By filling in essential
              commitments (lectures, work, etc.) the remaining time
              available is shown. Tailor the rest of the time to when
              studying is personally effective. The timetable should
              be adjusted for any upcoming events, or times of intense
              study, such as a major assessment or examinations.

          <div class="content2">
            <h3>Semester plan</h3>
            <p>Planning out the semester helps visualize and assess the amount
              of time needed for an assessment. It will also show choke points
              when there are multiple assessments due, and if more time should
              be allocated towards studies during those periods.

          <div class="content3">
            <p>After a plan has been created, a studying location needs to be
              established. The following page will outline what locations
              can be used to establish a study area.
